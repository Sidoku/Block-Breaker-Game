## About The Project

This single player game is a clone of Pong. The game was built as a solo project following a course on Udemy to gain an understanding of developing a game in Unity. The paddle has three collision zones that would direct the ball in different directions and each level contains different blocks that have special attributes.

* Movement: PLayer controls the paddle with mouse movement. At the start of each level, player can click left mouse button to launch the ball.
* Blocks: There are standard block which break on a single hit, blocks which crack and take multiple hits to break, and blocks which are unbreakable.
* Ball: The paddle has 3 collision zones which bounce the ball at different angles depending on where the ball makes contact with the paddle. The ball also gets a random angle on collision with the edges of the screen.
